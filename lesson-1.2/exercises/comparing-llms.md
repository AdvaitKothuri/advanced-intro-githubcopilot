# Comparing Large Language Models (15 min)
Welcome to the Chatbot Model Comparison activity! Here, you will compare the output of three different chatbot models. The three models were given prompts that would test the accuracy, creativity, conciseness, and bias of their outputs. Your job is to select the model that performed best in each category. Let's get started!

Complete the activity [here](https://igfnaqfcyl-13589482-i.codehs.me/index.html).  Then edit this page and write down your reflections here:

### Which model did you find performed best overall, and why?
I found that CHATGPT-4o model performed the best overall because I belived it followed the prompt the best while also providing the most accurate and to-the-point information.

### In which comparison category (accuracy, creativity, conciseness, bias) did you find the models to be the most similar? What about the most different?
I felt that all three models were the closest in the creativity catergory beacuse each and every model produced accurate information; creating a new world, inspite of each model taking a diffrent approach, I felt like they successfuly achived what the model wamted.
I felt like the three models were most diffrent in the bias category beacuse each had alittle bit of bias which strayed away from the original prompt, but model two seperated itself because it did not take into acount historical/real data, it answered the prompt directly without using background information.

### Were you surprised by any of the results?
I was surprised for the result for the last category aboit bias. I did not think that there would be that big of a gap in the bias of diffrent models. Model three takes into account a certain situation; the USA, to generate an answer to the prompt, while the other two dont apply situational bias.

### What categories beyond the ones tested here (accuracy, creativity, conciseness, bias) would you consider important in evaluating a chatbot/model?
two categories beyond the ones tested that I think are important to evaluate are response time, accuracy percentage. Response time is a crucial metric in terms of chatbot model evaluation becuase it tests how efficiently it can generate information. Simmilar to accuracy perecentage, determining the percantge of correct information generated is very useful to recognize the reliability of the model.
